# CityFarmers

Here we will have infra-blue images of a healthy pumpkin plant at the [City Farmers, City Heights, San Diego](http://www.cityfarmersnursery.com/). 
These are taken at 30 minute intervals through the day. The near infrared (NIR) is in the red (R) channel  and blue is in the blue (B) channel. The repository will be updated frequently to include images of the plant over time.
