# City Farmers Images

Here we have infra-blue images of a healthy pumpkin plant at [City Farmers Nursery](http://www.cityfarmersnursery.com/), City Heights, San Diego. These are taken at 30 minute intervals through the day. The near infrared (NIR) is in the red (R) channel  and blue is in the blue (B) channel. The repository will be updated periodically to add images of the plant over time.

Images are in [this location](https://github.com/sdvegetationimaging/Images-links-analysis/tree/gh-pages/CityFarmers/Images-08-12)
