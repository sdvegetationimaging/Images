# City Farmers Images

Here we have RGB and RGB+IR images of a patch at [City Farmers Nursery](http://www.cityfarmersnursery.com/), City Heights, San Diego. These are taken at 30 minute intervals through the day. A sample of images from each day are shared here. The repository will be updated periodically to add images of the plant over time. Images are located [here](https://github.com/sdvegetationimaging/Images-links-analysis/tree/gh-pages/CityFarmers/Images).
