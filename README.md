# Healthier plants by image sharing
Growing plants is inherently a process that depends on local conditions. The plant varieties that grow in one part of a city with as diverse a set of local climatic conditions as San Diego are uniquely suited to that area. Direct factors like climate, soil, light, air, and moisture vary widely from one part of the city to another, and so do the plants that thrive in them.  Communities that partake in producing and consuming plant resources are themselves diverse and their relationship to nature and and approach to plant growth, though invaluable and well suited to the task, is often misunderstood or missed altogehter. On the other hand, the knowledge required to grow healthy plants in a conscious manner is a culmination of decades of unrelenting attention to detail and living in and shaping the environment that supports their growth.



Learning successful growth strategies  requires observing plants under a range of conditions and studying their growth behavior, and making that data and knowledge available to the community. First and most valuable part of this project is to enable the community of people willing to share their knowledge, experience, and keen to learn from each other. The farming community, the researchers, the hobbyists and enthusiasts, the curious and everyone who believes in community ownership of and involvement in maintaining the environment and plant resources can step into this project with minimal effort.


The collection of tried and tested as well as emerging ideas in plant growth strategies is vast and expanding. A goal of this project is to make such knowledge accessible to the community through the use of computing and imaging technology that is available to everyone, increasingly sophisticated, and easy to learn and deploy. 
To accomplish this, inexpensive computers ([Raspberry Pi Zero W](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)) and cameras ([Pi Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/), [Pi Noir Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/))  capable of taking pictures in near infrared (NIR) band are set up to collect plant data over extended periods, for as many plants as possible and under different conditions. 






## Images and Plant Health
The images in this repository have been taken at different locations around San Diego. Most are infra-blue (these look bluish gray),  with two bands,  near infrared (NIR) and blue, instead of the normal RGB. NIR is recorded in the R channel in the image, and blue is in the B channel as usual. Infra-blue images can be used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of the photosynthetic activity occuring in the plant, measuring the plant health.
 
Here are the images from the current participants in this project:

## Image Analysis

NDVI calculated on infra-blue images, and other useful plant health indicators, coming soon! 

## Community participation

It is hoped that stronger plant growth and community member participation, will bring more of the local knowledge into the repository and make it all the richer, benefitting everyone. Besides the long term goal of helping communities cooperate and learn from the collective intelligence, there are immediate benefits to participation. Participants contributing their plant images have available the feedback from the community about the health and  nurturing of their plants.

## We Are

A group of independent researchers working to bring affordable  computer, imaging, sensor and data technologies to plant growth and care,  engage the community in creating its own solutions, and hoping to make a positive difference. We are self-funded.
