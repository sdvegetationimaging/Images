# Images
Plant Images in Infra-blue: Some of these images are taken in near infrared (NIR) and blue (these look bluish!). These can be used to calculate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that shows photosynthetic activity. More, including NDVI of the images, and many useful links to community  data, research, and activities coming soon!
