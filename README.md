# Plant growth is local  
In San Diego, plant growth is a local phenomenon. Direct factors like climate, soil, light, air, and moisture vary widely from one part of the city to another. So do the composition of  communities that partake in producing and consuming the plant resources. The knowledge required to grow healthy plants in a conscious manner is a culmination of decades of unrelenting attention to detail and living in and shaping the environment that supports their growth. The goal of this project is to make some of that knowledge accessible to the community through the use of computing and imaging technology that is available to everyone, increasingly sophisticated, and easy to learn and deploy. 

The first and most valuable part of this project is the community of people willing to share their knowledge, experience, and keen to learn from each other. This is a participatory effort in which the farming community, the researchers, the hobbyists, the curious and everyone who believes in community ownership of and involvement in maintaining the environment and plant resources can step into with minimal effort.



# Community participation
This requires observing plants under a range of conditions and learning their growth behavior, and making that data and knowledge available to the community. This process is a give and take in which stronger plant growth and community member participation, it is hoped, will bring more of the local knowledge into the repository and make it all the richer.

To accomplish this, inexpensive computers ([Raspberry Pi Zero W](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)) and cameras ([Pi Noir Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/))  capable of taking pictures in near infrared (NIR) range are used to collect plant data over extended periods, for  many plants and under different conditions. 

Besides the long term goal outlined above, there are immediate benefits of community participation in this project. Anyone who participates in contributing images of their plants will get feedback from the community about their plants' health,  if such advice is sought.






## Images 
The images in this repository have been taken at different locations around San Diego. Most are infra-blue (these look bluish gray),  with two bands,  near infrared (NIR) and blue, instead of the normal RGB. NIR is recorded in the R channel in the image, and blue is in the B channel as usual. This facilitates calcualtion of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, see links below), an indicator of photosynthetic activity. The setup consists of a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and a [Pi Noir Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/). Infra-blue images can be used to calculate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that shows photosynthetic activity.
