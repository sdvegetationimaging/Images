# Images
Plant Images: The images in this repository have been taken at different locations around San Diego. Some of these images are taken in near infrared (NIR) and blue (these look grayish!). These can be used to calculate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that shows photosynthetic activity. More, including NDVI of the images, and many useful links to community  data, research, and activities coming soon!
