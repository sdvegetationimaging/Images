# Healthier Plants by Image Sharing
The process of growing plants inherently depends on local conditions. The  plant varieties that thrive in one part of a city, with as diverse a set of  climatic and terrain conditions as San Diego, are best adapted to the conditions existing there. Direct factors like weather, temperature, soil composition, light, air, and moisture vary widely from one part of the city to another, reflected in the local plant life.  Communities that partake in producing and consuming plant resources are themselves diverse and their relationship to nature and approach to plant growth, though invaluable and well suited to the task, are often misunderstood or missed altogether.  Accumulating the knowledge and  practices to grow healthy plants in a conscious manner is a culmination of decades, if not generations, of unrelenting attention to detail and living in and shaping the environment that supports their growth.



Learning successful growth strategies  requires observing plants under a range of conditions and studying their growth behavior, and making that data and knowledge available to the community. First and essential part of this project is to enable the community of people willing to share their knowledge and experience, and those who may be open to learning from others, to be more effective at it. The farming community, the researchers, the hobbyists and enthusiasts, the curious and everyone who believes in community ownership of and involvement in maintaining the environment and plant resources can step into this project with minimal effort.


The collection of tried and tested as well as emerging ideas in plant growth strategies is vast and expanding. A goal of this project is to make such knowledge accessible to the community through the use of computing and imaging technology that is available to everyone, increasingly sophisticated, and easy to learn and use. 
To accomplish this, inexpensive computers ([Raspberry Pi Zero W](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)) and cameras ([Pi Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/), [Pi Noir Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/))  capable of taking pictures in near infrared (NIR) band are set up to collect plant data over extended periods, for as many plants as possible and under different conditions. 






## Images and Plant Health
The images in this repository are to be taken at different locations around San Diego. Each picture is taken in two modes: RGB (normal) and RGB+IR (No IR Filter). These can be used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of the photosynthetic activity occuring in the plant, measuring the plant health.
 
Here are the images from the current participants in this project (more to be added soon).

## Image Analysis

Useful plant health indicators, such as NDVI calculated on infra-blue images, coming soon. 

## Community Participation

Better plant growth as a result of  community participation and  information sharing makes the repository richer, more useful, with a stronger focus on local conditions, to everyone's advantage. Besides the long term goal of helping community members cooperate and learn from the collective intelligence, there are immediate benefits to participation. Participants contributing their plant images have available the feedback from the community about the health and  nurturing of their plants.

## We Are

A group of independent researchers working to bring affordable  computer, imaging, sensor and data technologies to plant growth and care,  engage the community in creating its own solutions, and hoping to make a positive difference. We are self-funded.
